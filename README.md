# Authentication System
## A mini-project made in C++ without using any external libraries.

Features include a fully working login and registration system, persistance in a local database .csv file, password hashing with own custom algorithm and encryption of the hash. 

Will extend functionalities in future projects or possibly implement a fully-working API.

Will use almost everything there is in the language in terms of object-oriented programming.

### Made in VS Code, maximizing on terminal usage to get used to it and to use something different of an IDE.
